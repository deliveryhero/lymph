Tests
~~~~~

You can test if your installation of lymph has been successful by running the
unittests. You'll also have to set ``ZOOKEEPER_PATH`` to the directory that
contains your ZooKeeper binaries (e.g. ``/usr/share/java`` on Ubuntu).

You can then run the tests with either `tox`_ or ``nosetests`` directly.

.. FIXME add unittesting coverage as well
